Datasets:
These datasets are exemplary segmented EEG time series recordings of ten epilepsy patients collected from Neurology & Sleep Centre, Hauz Khas, New Delhi. The data was acquired at sampling rate of 200 Hz using Grass Telefactor Comet AS40 Amplification System. During the acquisition, gold plated scalp EEG electrodes were placed according to 10-20 electrode placement system. The signals were filtered between 0.5 to 70 Hz and then segmented into pre-ictal, interictal and ictal stages. Each downloadable folder contains fifty MAT-files of EEG time series signals. The name of the folder corresponds to the epileptic seizure stage. Each MAT-file consists of 1024 samples of one EEG time series data lasting for a duration of 5.12 seconds.     

Note: The datasets are part of an ongoing research work in collaboration of Neurocomputing Laboratory at IIT Delhi and Neurology & Sleep Centre, Hauz Khas. Kindly cite this link and following manuscript(s) when you publish results based the EEG signals available in this page. The complete EEG datasets can be made available on request after the publication of the results.
